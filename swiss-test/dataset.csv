Some people recommend wild camping on beaches for free, but this isn’t actually allowed in most places due to the delicate environment. Plus, it’s too easy to wander onto sacred grounds, which is a big no-no.",beach
"fter spending time there, I can say that I MUCH preferred Lahaina as a place – it’s cute, with lots of character, right on the waterfront, and has the majority of the nightlife. Kanapa’ali is mostly resorts and a shopping centre (Whaler’s Village) and has little character, but it has great beaches, so I was happy we did it the way we did as it was nice to be able to just stroll to the beach and it was easier enough to get taxis in the evenings.",beach
"My favourite stop on the Road to Hana was Wai’anapanapa State Park, where we swam in the water off the black sand beach. I would definitely suggest that you bring water shoes for this as the pebbles hurt your feet and are difficult to walk on.",beach

"Covering most of Northern Africa – 3.6 million square miles – the Sahara Desert is the third largest desert on the planet and the largest hot desert. While many people often think of the gorgeous sand dunes that are found in the Sahara, they only comprise a small portion. The landscape is primarily made of rocky hamada, or barren land with rocky plateaus. You’ll also find small patches of grassland (albeit sparse), shrubs of the desert variety, mountains, and salt flats.",desert
"The desert is an incredibly harsh environment with lows going well below zero degrees in the winter, and water sources are almost nonexistent, making the area almost devoid of flora and fauna. Even those on the Silk Road tried to avoid the area by traveling on the fringes of the desert.",desert
" The most populated desert on the planet, the Thar Desert is home to 83 people per square kilometer. The landscape is identifiable by large shifting sand dunes, which cover most of the desert, along with alluvial plains and salt lakes that appear during monsoon season.

"From there, we made our way south to Windermere. It’s the largest natural lake in the country, home to 18 islands and stretching some 18km in length. It’s a long, narrow lake (it’s less than 2km wide) that started to grow in popularity as early as the 1850s, after new railway lines made it accessible.",lake
"I noticed that the lake was busier than Ullswater, and that trend continued as we kept exploring. The farther south we went, the busier it got. I enjoyed the northern lakes more because of this.",lake

"NYC, a city forever in flux, is impossible to “see” in one visit.

This city is home to thousands of restaurants, hundreds of museums, attractions, plays, and quirky things to do.

"We even got to go up at night, it’s a whole different experience, but you have to do both! Yes it’s colder, and probably just as busy, but this is when you see properly the city that never sleeps. So many different colours run through the city, and this is when I realised how bright Times Square actually is with all its billboards since it stills blinds you from the top of The Empire State!",city
"This was our last afternoon in New York, so we decided to do probably the most iconic thing in the city, Times Square (again), it’s just amazing it’s something you see all the time on TV so we just had to finish off the trip with that. And to top it off it was full of Halloween decorations, literally pumpkins EVERYWHERE, and what was brilliant about it was that the pumpkins were free to take for the public, it was to make sure that the whole city was decorated which I think is the most amazing idea, literally brings the whole city together.",city
